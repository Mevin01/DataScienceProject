Data Science Assignment

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Data Science assignment for the role at Tranzmeo IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd. 
The task involves analyzing NOAA climate data for Ann Arbor, Michigan, covering the years 2005 to 2015.


Files
Project file.ipynb: Interactive Python Notebook with the code for data analysis and visualization.
temperature.csv: NOAA temperature dataset.
BinSize.csv: Contains additional data used for the assignment.

Tasks
Temperature Visualization (2005-2014):
Analyze the dataset to plot a line graph of record high and low temperatures by day of the year.
Shade the area between the record high and low temperatures for each day.

2015 Data Overlay:
Overlay a scatter plot on the graph showing days in 2015 where temperatures broke the record highs or lows from 2005-2014.

Leap Day Handling:
Remove leap day data (February 29) from the dataset to maintain consistency in visualizations.

Data Presentation:
Ensure that the graph includes appropriate legends, labels, and avoids unnecessary chart elements.

Geospatial Visualization:
Map the locations of weather stations near Ann Arbor using the provided data.

Temperature Summary for 2015:
Plot a summary of daily temperatures for Ann Arbor in 2015.
